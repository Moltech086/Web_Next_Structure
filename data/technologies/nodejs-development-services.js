      "Node.js is a lightweight, high-performance runtime environment that allows developers to use JavaScript to build fast, scalable server-side applications. JavaScript is also used on the front end. This means that the tech stack you use for your whole application, including the front end and the back end, might be the same.",
    descriptionTwo:
      "Node.js is different from previous backend solutions because it uses an event-driven, non-blocking design. This means that requests are handled in order, which slows things down as demand builds. In other words, it can manage thousands of users at once without crashing or slowing down. This makes it great for real-time apps, APIs, dashboards, and platforms that need to be fast and responsive.",

      <h5>Why It Matters for Your Business:</h5>
      <ul>
      <li><b>Faster Time-to-Market:</b> Reuse code and streamline development with one language across the stack.</li>
      <li><b>Scalable from Day One:</b> Built to handle high volumes of simultaneous requests - ideal for growing startups and enterprise platforms.</li>
      <li><b>Cost Efficiency:</b> Fewer tools, fewer developers, less complexity.</li>
      <li><b>Real-World Proven:</b> Powering apps at Netflix, LinkedIn, Uber, PayPal - Node.js is trusted at scale.</li>
