    description: `<b>React Native</b> is an <b>open-source JavaScript framework</b> created by <b>Meta (Facebook)</b> that lets you build native <b>mobile apps for iOS and Android</b> — using a <b>single codebase</b>.`,
    descriptionTwo: `
    <p>
      Instead of maintaining two separate teams for each platform, you write one set of code that powers <b>high-performance, platform-specific apps</b>. This makes React Native a <b>cost-effective, scalable, and future-ready</b> choice for businesses of all sizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>React Native</b> ecosystem includes powerful tools and libraries such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Expo</b> – for rapid prototyping and testing
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Redux</b> – for predictable state management
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Firebase, AWS, and Google Cloud</b> – for seamless backend integration
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Visual Studio Code</b> – for a fast and efficient development environment
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For your business, React Native delivers:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Faster time-to-market</b> – Launch up to 40% quicker than native-only builds
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Lower development costs</b> – Save money with one codebase and a unified development team
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Consistent user experience </b> – Provide a polished, reliable app on every device
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Proven scalability</b> – Trusted by Shopify, Tesla, Instagram, and Microsoft to serve millions of users worldwide
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In short, React Native combines the <b>performance of native apps</b> with the speed and <b>cost-efficiency</b> of modern JavaScript development — helping you bring ideas to life faster and smarter.
