      "Angular is Google's free front-end framework for making web pages that work like apps and load quickly. You might think of it as an entire construction kit. It includes pre-made bricks for navigation, forms, data handling, and testing, and they all fit together well. Angular is built on TypeScript, which is a safer and more dependable version of JavaScript. It helps keep big projects organized and finds errors early, which saves you valuable time.",
