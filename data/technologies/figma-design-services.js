      <strong>Why it matters for your business?</strong>
      <p>
        Faster cycles: High-fidelity prototypes, live collaboration, and design systems speed up wireframes, which can shorten the time it takes to go from design to development by 30–40%.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cleaner handoffs: Inspectable parts, tokens, and specs help cut down on errors that happen because of miscommunication.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aligned teams: Stakeholders can leave comments directly on designs, and FigJam helps with research, workshops, and approvals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Connected workflow: There are thousands of plugins and connectors (like Slack, Jira, and Notion) that keep design, PM, and engineering on the same page.
      </p>
      <p>
        In brief, Figma is more than just a design tool. It's an execution engine that speeds up feedback loops and helps you provide consistent, user-friendly experiences on both web and mobile.
